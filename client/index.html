        A Dark Cave – Text-Based Survival &amp; Incremental Browser Game
      </h1>

      <p>
        A Dark Cave is a free text-based survival game playable in your
        browser. Explore an ancient cave, find the remains of a lost
        civilization, and uncover their dark secrets. Gather resources, build
        a settlement, and manage villagers as you push deeper into a world
        that doesn't want to be found. No download required.
      </p>

      <h2 style="color: #aaa">An Incremental Survival RPG</h2>

      <p>
        Inspired by A Dark Room, Candy Box, Kittens Game, and Darkest Dungeon.
        Incremental idle mechanics meet settlement building, resource management, turn-based combat,
        and Lovecraftian horror.
      </p>

      <h2 style="color: #aaa">Gather, Craft, Upgrade</h2>

      <p>
        Collect resources, craft tools and weapons, upgrade buildings and skills
        through multiple tiers. Assign villagers to jobs, unlock new schematics,
        and expand your settlement to survive what lies ahead.
      </p>

      <h2 style="color: #aaa">Fellowship Companions</h2>

      <p>
        Recruit companions with their own storylines. A wandering knight, an
        aging wizard, a wildling huntress bound by blood oath, and many more. Each is earned through choices and changes
        how you play.
      </p>

      <h2 style="color: #aaa">Explore a Dark World</h2>

      <p>
        Venture into ancient forests, forgotten ruins, and hostile lands.
        Encounter strangers, face attack waves, and confront things that
        should have stayed buried.
      </p>

      <h2 style="color: #aaa">Combat &amp; Crafting</h2>

      <p>
        Fight enemies in turn-based combat with crafted weapons, bombs, and
        combat skills. Build defenses to protect your settlement from what
        comes out of the dark.
      </p>

      <h2 style="color: #aaa">Dark Fantasy Atmosphere</h2>

      <p>
        The story unfolds through events, choices, and discovery. Build
        shrines and monuments. Unlock forbidden knowledge. Some choices
        strengthen your people. Others lead to madness.
      </p>

      <h2 style="color: #aaa">Play Free in Your Browser</h2>

      <p>
        Free HTML5 browser game on desktop and mobile. Progress saves locally.
        Idle mode lets your settlement grow while you are away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Enter the cave. Light the first fire. See how far you can survive.
