by means of a clear declaration (e.g., a letter sent by post or an email) of your decision to withdraw from this contract. You can use the attached model withdrawal form, but it is not mandatory.

To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.

### Consequences of Withdrawal
If you withdraw from this contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than fourteen days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.

### **Premature Expiry of the Right of Withdrawal**
**For contracts concerning the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium, the right of withdrawal expires if we have begun with the performance of the contract after you have expressly consented that we begin with the performance of the contract before the expiry of the withdrawal period, and you have acknowledged your awareness that you lose your right of withdrawal by your consent with the beginning of the performance of the contract.**

**In "A Dark Cave," the digital goods you purchase are delivered and credited to your account immediately. Therefore, before completing the purchase, you will be required to:**
1.  **Expressly agree that we begin with the execution of the contract (i.e., the delivery of the digital item) before the withdrawal period ends.**
2.  **Acknowledge that by doing so, you waive your right of withdrawal.**

**This will be implemented via a checkbox that must be ticked before you can finalize the payment.**
