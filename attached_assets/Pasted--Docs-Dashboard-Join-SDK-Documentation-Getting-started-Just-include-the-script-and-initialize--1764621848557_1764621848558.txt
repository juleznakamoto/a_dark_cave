Getting started
Just include the script and initialize it.

Quick start
Choose your preferred method to add Playlight to your site.

ESM via CDN (Recommended)
IIFE via CDN
NPM package

<!-- Add to head -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://sdk.playlight.dev/playlight-sdk.css">

<script type="module">
// If used with a framework, init after hydration (onMount/useEffect/mounted)
  try {
    const module = await import("https://sdk.playlight.dev/playlight-sdk.es.js");
    const playlightSDK = module.default;
    playlightSDK.init();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error loading the Playlight SDK:", error);
  }
</script>
Congrats! This is all you need to integrate Playlight.

Configuration
Customize the behavior and appearance.

Object
Exit intent
Sidebar
Sidebar
Configure how the sidebar should be displayed.

forceVisible boolean false
Set this to true to show the sidebar to everyone and not only visitors from Playlight.

hasFrameworkRoot any "auto"
By default, this attempts to auto-detect whether or not there is a root element created by a framework. For example, React, Vue or Svelte create a root node. If you use other frameworks (e.g. Astro) or vanilla and experience issues, set this to false.

Note
Please thoroughly test this with forceVisible: true to ensure all styles work correctly. Certain units and media queries will be overriden, and some window methods and properties polyfilled.

Widget
Add an interactive Playlight widget.


<!-- Carousel Widget, width of min. 500px is recommended -->
<div class="playlight-widget-carousel"
     style="height: 330px; width: 750px;">
</div>
Add a carousel widget by creating a container with the class as seen above.

Recommended dimensions: 330px height, min. 500px width
Widget is transparent – add background, padding etc. as you wish
Loads dynamically – ideal for death screens and mode selection UIs
Dos and Don'ts
What you should and shouldn't do when integrating Playlight.

Do
Use the ES module to allow for tree shaking and load it async

Use .setConfig() to dynamically adjust the configuration depending on the game state

Create your own custom Discovery button using the .setDiscovery() method

Ensure that it nicely integrates into your game UI and behaves predictably

Don't
Make it difficult for players to bring up the Discovery

Only load the SDK on some of the site's pages or after interactions

Place two widgets on the same page
